They also feature cooling holes on the core so heat will dissipate rapidly.</P> <P>     These diamond blades are for use on high speed, hand held gas saws as well as low horsepower walk behind and table saws. They're great for many tough applications including asphalt, green concrete, reinforced concrete and stone materials. </P>"

   "description": "<P>     These are high speed cutters, sometimes referred to as annular cutters. They will cut 3 times faster than a hole saw or twist drill and will last 300 times longer than a hole saw also. They are made from precision ground, M2 high speed steel. They will cut clean, accurate, burr-free holes in sheet metal, pipe, wood and plastics. </P> <P>    You get seven cutters, 5/16\" to 3/4\" by 1/16\" increments. You also get an arbor that will fit 3/8\" or 1/2\" chucks, there are 2 pilots, 2 stop washers and an adjusting wrench. They come in a handy kit for easy storage.</P> <P>   These are perfect for cutting irregular shaped holes and slots, \"O\"-Ring holes, partial holes, (shallow or deep) and they make perfect pipe joints a breeze. They can also be used to cutoff broken or stuck nuts and bolts.</P>"

You can adjust the depth that you will drive the screw in by adjusting the head of the bit holder.  Just screw it back or forward on the shaft to set the depth, and then screw the other half tight against the half you just set. </P> <P>They have a magnetic head that \"grabs\" the driver head, like the #2 Phillips head provided. This magnetizes the tip so that when you place a screw near it, the screw head almost aligns itself and you get a sure fit of the driver bit and screw head.</P>"

   "description": "<P>      These are the 'Super Premium' American made drill bits from' Magnum. They'll cut razor sharp holes through stainless steel, spring steel, and grade 8 bolts without chipping or breaking and you can't mix them up with other bits because where the flutes are cut, they're bright gold in color.</P> <P>     These bits will drill 30% faster than Cobalt because they have the thinner web. They also have the 118_ split point which makes these bits self-starting, self-centering, and self-tapping so you don't need a starter bit or a punch and they will drill through 1/4\" trailer hitch plate like a hot knife through butter!</P> <P>      This set has a reduced 1/2\" shank with three flat sides and can be used in a drill press or a regular hand drill without slipping. This is a 4 piece set that includes 9/16\", 5/8\", 3/4\", and 1\"</P>"

   "description": "<P>       This is the American made Goodyear 'Horizon' red rubber air hose. It is rated at 250 PSI bursting strength and features two ply of tough nylon braid reinforcing and two ply of Goodyear rubber. The rubber jacket is resistant to oils and chemicals. There are 1/4\" male brass fittings on the ends and it's all set to hook up. </P> <P>      A 1/4\" hose is sufficient to run your 1/4\" and 3/8\" drive air tools as well as air sanders, hammers, saws etc. It is not recommended for 1/2\" air tools as the smaller hose does not permit the volume of air needed. </P> <P>     1/4\" hose is also preferred by roofers as it allows the right pressure for nail guns and, because it is lighter in weight it is ideal when dragging across a roof. </P>"

Natural white cotton, poly blend, string knit. Large is one size fits all'. X-Large also available. Imported.</P>"

The strong, lightweight fiberglass pole telescopes to 12 feet with an infinitely adjustable twist-lock extender and non-pinching twist-lock adjustment.

   "description": "<P>     The shock absorbing design of the new line of forged solid steel hammers from Plumb? utilizes exclusive vibration reduction technology for ultimate anti-vibration performance. The result is a hammer that can be used all day with less fatigue and a lower chance of joint discomfort.</P> <P>     Dual material contoured grips add exceptional comfort and control and a magnetic nail starter on the head holds nail firmly in place, eliminating the risk of striking the other hand when starting a nail. These Plumb? hammers also feature a waffle head for framing applications, and are rip style for fast removal of nails. Import.</P>"

The result is a small 'spot' that's quickly heated to the melting point, this forms a nugget of welded metal after the current is removed.</P> <P>       Perhaps the most common application of spot welding is in automobile manufacturing, where it is used almost universally to weld the sheet metal to form a car. Used in body shops, farms, metal fabrication, etc.</P> <P>       This is a single phase and portable, electric spot welder that can be used with mild, galvanized or stainless steel. It features electric control of the spot welding time and an applied spot welding thickness of 1.0 + 1.0 mm. \n\n\n\nIMPORT</P>"

   "image": "assets/img/items/MO1.jpeg",
   "description": "<P>    This awesome package contains 10 Oshlun?metal cutting saw blades (ITEM# ASB14) @ $199.90 each and a free Milwaukee? 14\" dry-cut chop saw (ITEM# PM6190-20). </P> <P>This package is limited to quantity on hand so when they're gone, they're gone and there are no substitutions.</P> <P>      These are ferrous metal cutting blades that feature a triple chip grind and special C-6 carbide tips. They will cut through all types of mild steel, such as steel studs, piping, tubing, channel, flat stock rebar and more. </P> <P>      The special carbide on these blades resists breakage and last longer than ordinary abrasive discs and other carbide grades. They leave a much cleaner cut, without the sharp burrs that abrasive discs leave behind. This blade is 14\" with 120 teeth and a 1\" arbor.</P> <P>    The Milwaukee 14\" metal cutoff machine utilizes dry cut technology which cuts an average of three times faster and cost about 1-1/2 time less to use than an abrasive machine.</P> <P>    The saw emits little or no sparks when cutting and leaves a virtually burr-free finish.</P> <P>     Features a powerful 14 HP, 4.8 amp, 15 speed motor. It has a 5-3/8\" cutting capacity, a heavy duty cast aluminum base that is reinforced with 1/4\" steel plate, and a tool-free adjusting and pivoting fence.</P>"

   "description": "<P>           These precision ground taps have nitro-carburized flutes that are razor sharp and you can't mix these up with other taps because they're bright gold in color. They are spiral point, construction taps that drive your chips ahead of the tap so you get higher speeds and faster cutting with less work!  </P> <P>          The threads are precision ground in a three step process so you get the absolute most in accuracy and performance. These are for stainless steel and all other hard metals and are the plug style spiral pointed taps that are perfect for production tapping. </P> <P>          This 54 piece set includes all 3 of the tap and drill sets, (coarse, fine and metric) in theis individual metal cases.</P>"
